Some UI customizations for Gaffer, particularly on Windows. New orange and black look and generally larger text, plus some custom icons.

To install, just merge the two folders in this repo into your Gaffer folder.

There are two Windows-specific (I assume) fonts in __StyleSheet.py_, assigned to `monospaceFontFamily` and `mainFontFamily` (lines 152-153). The theme should work on just fine on Linux if you change those to some appropriate fonts.

There's a _gaffer.ico_ icon in the _graphics_ folder for use in Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts.
